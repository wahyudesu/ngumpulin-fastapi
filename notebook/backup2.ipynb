Penjelasan \n \n- HTML :  \nHeader:Terdapat elemen <header> yang menampilkan judul halaman dengan nama \npembuatnya. \n \nWrapper dan Konten:  Di dalam elemen <div class=\"wrapper\">, terdapat beberapa \nelemen <div class=\"page\"> yang masing -masing berisi tautan (<a>) ke berbagai \nsitus web. \nSetiap tautan memiliki gambar (<img>) yang berfungsi sebagai ikon untuk \nmengakses situs tersebut. Gambar -gambar ini memiliki atribut alt dan title untuk \nmemberikan informasi tambahan.  \n \nDaftar Tautan: \nTautan yang disediakan mencakup berbagai kategori, seperti:  \nHiburan: SMTown, JYP Entertainment, JKT48, YG Entertainment, HYBE.  \nOlahraga: Arsenal. \nMedia Sosial: TikTok. \nFilm: Studio Ghibli.Perbankan: Bank Mandiri.Aplikasi: CapCut. \n \nFooter: Terdapat elemen <footer> yang mencantumkan informasi hak cipta untuk \ntahun 2025, menunjukkan bahwa halaman ini mungkin baru atau diperbarui pada \ntahun tersebut. \n \n- CSS :  \n \n1. Menghilangkan margin default pada elemen html dan body untuk memastikan\n\ntidak ada ruang kosong di sekitar halaman.\n\n2. Header berfungsi sebagai area identifikasi halaman, menampilkan judul yang \njelas. Dengan ukuran yang cukup besar dan teks yang terpusat, header \nmemudahkan pengguna untuk mengenali konten halaman dengan cepat.  \n3. Wrapper berfungsi sebagai kontainer untuk semua elemen konten. Dengan \nukuran yang cukup besar dan margin, wrapper membantu mengorganisir \nkonten di dalamnya, memberikan struktur yang jelas dan memisahkan konten \ndari elemen lain di halaman. \n4. Setiap elemen .page di dalam wrapper berfungsi sebagai tautan ke berbagai \nsitus web. Dengan pengaturan lebar dan tinggi yang konsisten, elemen ini \nmemastikan bahwa semua tautan memiliki ukuran yang seragam, \nmemudahkan pengguna untuk mengklik dan menavigasi . Penggunaan display: \ninline-block memungkinkan elemen untuk ditampilkan berdampingan, \nmenciptakan tata letak yang efisien.  \n5. Footer memberikan informasi penting seperti hak cipta. Dengan penempatan\n\nyang konsisten di bagian bawah halaman, footer memastikan bahwa informasi \nini selalu terlihat oleh pengguna, meningkatkan aksesibilitas informasi.  \n6. Gambar yang berfungsi sebagai tautan diatur dengan ukuran yang sesuai dan \nmargin untuk memberikan ruang di sekitarnya, sehingga memudahkan \npengguna untuk mengklik tanpa kesulitan.  \n7. Efek hover yang diterapkan memberikan umpan balik visual kepada \npengguna, menunjukkan bahwa gambar tersebut dapat diklik, meningkatkan \ninteraktivitas. \n \nB.

Output\n\nKetika cursor ke logo tertentu\n\nKetika dipencet logo tertentu nya \n \n3. Penjelasan Perubahan CSS  \nPembaruan ini berfokus pada peningkatan estetika dan fungsionalitas halaman. Dengan \nmenggunakan gradasi warna, font yang lebih baik, dan pengaturan tata letak yang responsif, \nhalaman menjadi lebih menarik dan mudah dinavigasi. Penambahan efek transisi dan hover \njuga meningkatkan interaktivitas, memberikan pengalaman pengguna yang lebih baik.  \n1. Menambahkan baris untuk mengimpor font \"Lora\" dari Google Fonts, yang \nmemberikan tampilan yang lebih elegan dan konsisten di seluruh halaman.  \n2. Menggunakan gradasi warna untuk latar belakang html dan body, memberikan \ntampilan yang lebih menarik dan lembut dengan kombinasi warna biru muda.  \n3. Mengubah latar belakang header menjadi gradasi biru, meningkatkan kontras dengan \nteks putih. Padding ditambahkan untuk memberikan ruang yang lebih baik di sekitar \nteks. \n4. Menyesuaikan ukuran font untuk judul header menjadi 50px dan menambahkan efek\n\nbayangan teks untuk meningkatkan keterbacaan.  \n5. Mengubah warna latar belakang wrapper menjadi lebih cerah dengan transparansi, \nmemberikan kesan lebih ringan.  \n6. Menggunakan Flexbox untuk mengatur elemen di dalam wrapper, memungkinkan tata \nletak yang responsif dan terorganisir. \n7. Menambahkan border-radius dan box-shadow untuk memberikan efek kedalaman dan \nestetika yang lebih baik. \n8. Menambahkan transisi untuk efek hover, membuat interaksi lebih halus dengan skala \nyang lebih kecil dan bayangan yang lebih dalam saat pengguna mengarahkan kursor.  \n9. Menggunakan object-fit: cover untuk memastikan gambar tetap proporsional dan tidak \nterdistorsi. \n10. Mengurangi efek grayscale pada hover menjadi 30%, memberikan efek visual yang \nlebih ringan. \n11. Mengubah latar belakang footer menjadi gradasi biru yang konsisten dengan header, \nmenciptakan kesatuan visual.\n\nPercobaan 2 : Membuat HomePage Pribadi  \n1. Menyiapkan foto pribadi  \n \n2.

Penjelasan \n \n- HTML :  \nHeader:Terdapat elemen <header> yang menampilkan judul halaman dengan nama \npembuatnya. \n \nWrapper dan Konten:  Di dalam elemen <div class=\"wrapper\">, terdapat beberapa \nelemen <div class=\"page\"> yang masing -masing berisi tautan (<a>) ke berbagai \nsitus web. \nSetiap tautan memiliki gambar (<img>) yang berfungsi sebagai ikon untuk \nmengakses situs tersebut. Gambar -gambar ini memiliki atribut alt dan title untuk \nmemberikan informasi tambahan.  \n \nDaftar Tautan: \nTautan yang disediakan mencakup berbagai kategori, seperti:  \nHiburan: SMTown, JYP Entertainment, JKT48, YG Entertainment, HYBE.  \nOlahraga: Arsenal. \nMedia Sosial: TikTok. \nFilm: Studio Ghibli.Perbankan: Bank Mandiri.Aplikasi: CapCut. \n \nFooter: Terdapat elemen <footer> yang mencantumkan informasi hak cipta untuk \ntahun 2025, menunjukkan bahwa halaman ini mungkin baru atau diperbarui pada \ntahun tersebut. \n \n- CSS :  \n \n1. Menghilangkan margin default pada elemen html dan body untuk memastikan\n\ntidak ada ruang kosong di sekitar halaman.\n\n2. Header berfungsi sebagai area identifikasi halaman, menampilkan judul yang \njelas. Dengan ukuran yang cukup besar dan teks yang terpusat, header \nmemudahkan pengguna untuk mengenali konten halaman dengan cepat.  \n3. Wrapper berfungsi sebagai kontainer untuk semua elemen konten. Dengan \nukuran yang cukup besar dan margin, wrapper membantu mengorganisir \nkonten di dalamnya, memberikan struktur yang jelas dan memisahkan konten \ndari elemen lain di halaman. \n4. Setiap elemen .page di dalam wrapper berfungsi sebagai tautan ke berbagai \nsitus web. Dengan pengaturan lebar dan tinggi yang konsisten, elemen ini \nmemastikan bahwa semua tautan memiliki ukuran yang seragam, \nmemudahkan pengguna untuk mengklik dan menavigasi . Penggunaan display: \ninline-block memungkinkan elemen untuk ditampilkan berdampingan, \nmenciptakan tata letak yang efisien.  \n5. Footer memberikan informasi penting seperti hak cipta. Dengan penempatan\n\nyang konsisten di bagian bawah halaman, footer memastikan bahwa informasi \nini selalu terlihat oleh pengguna, meningkatkan aksesibilitas informasi.  \n6. Gambar yang berfungsi sebagai tautan diatur dengan ukuran yang sesuai dan \nmargin untuk memberikan ruang di sekitarnya, sehingga memudahkan \npengguna untuk mengklik tanpa kesulitan.  \n7. Efek hover yang diterapkan memberikan umpan balik visual kepada \npengguna, menunjukkan bahwa gambar tersebut dapat diklik, meningkatkan \ninteraktivitas. \n \nB.

Dengan \nmenggunakan gradasi warna, font yang lebih baik, dan pengaturan tata letak yang responsif, \nhalaman menjadi lebih menarik dan mudah dinavigasi. Penambahan efek transisi dan hover \njuga meningkatkan interaktivitas, memberikan pengalaman pengguna yang lebih baik.  \n1. Menambahkan baris untuk mengimpor font \"Lora\" dari Google Fonts, yang \nmemberikan tampilan yang lebih elegan dan konsisten di seluruh halaman.  \n2. Menggunakan gradasi warna untuk latar belakang html dan body, memberikan \ntampilan yang lebih menarik dan lembut dengan kombinasi warna biru muda.  \n3. Mengubah latar belakang header menjadi gradasi biru, meningkatkan kontras dengan \nteks putih. Padding ditambahkan untuk memberikan ruang yang lebih baik di sekitar \nteks. \n4. Menyesuaikan ukuran font untuk judul header menjadi 50px dan menambahkan efek\n\nbayangan teks untuk meningkatkan keterbacaan.  \n5. Mengubah warna latar belakang wrapper menjadi lebih cerah dengan transparansi, \nmemberikan kesan lebih ringan.  \n6. Menggunakan Flexbox untuk mengatur elemen di dalam wrapper, memungkinkan tata \nletak yang responsif dan terorganisir. \n7. Menambahkan border-radius dan box-shadow untuk memberikan efek kedalaman dan \nestetika yang lebih baik. \n8. Menambahkan transisi untuk efek hover, membuat interaksi lebih halus dengan skala \nyang lebih kecil dan bayangan yang lebih dalam saat pengguna mengarahkan kursor.  \n9. Menggunakan object-fit: cover untuk memastikan gambar tetap proporsional dan tidak \nterdistorsi. \n10. Mengurangi efek grayscale pada hover menjadi 30%, memberikan efek visual yang \nlebih ringan. \n11. Mengubah latar belakang footer menjadi gradasi biru yang konsisten dengan header, \nmenciptakan kesatuan visual.\n\nPercobaan 2 : Membuat HomePage Pribadi  \n1. Menyiapkan foto pribadi  \n \n2.

Struktur  Dasar  HTML  Struktur  dan   elemen  dasar  yang  digunakan  yaitu:  <!DOCTYPE  html>  →  Menentukan  bahwa  dokumen  ini  adalah  HTML  <html>  →  Elemen  root  yang  melakukan  wrap  untuk  seluruh  halaman.  <head>  →  Berisi  metadata  halaman,  termasuk  judul  dan  stylesheet.  <body>  →  Berisi  konten  utama  yang  ditampilkan  di  halaman.  2.  Elemen  dalam  <head>  <title>Fast  Access  Web  Menu</title>  →  Menampilkan  judul  halaman  di  tab  browser.  <link  rel=\"stylesheet\"  href=\"CSS/app2.css\">  →  Menghubungkan  halaman  dengan  file  CSS  eksternal  (app2.css).  3.  Elemen  dalam  <body>  a)  <header>  <header>      <h1>Fast  Access  Web  Menu</h1>  </header>  Bagian  header  menampilkan  judul  utama  \"Fast  Access  Web  Menu\"  di  dalam  elemen  <h1>.  b)  Wrapper  (<div  class=\"wrapper\">)  <div  class=\"wrapper\">  Wrapper  ini  berfungsi  sebagai  container  utama  untuk  mengelompokkan  elemen  di  dalamnya.  5.  Tambahkan  file\n\nbaru  bernama  app2.css  pada  folder  csss  dan  tambahkan  kode  sebagai\n\nberikut\n html,  body {      margin:  0px;  }   header {      background-color:  #EB8716;      color:  #fff;      width:  98%;      height:  200px;      margin:  1%;      text-align:  center;  /*  Center  the  header  text  */  }   header h1 {      font-family:  'Franklin  Gothic  Medium',  'Arial  Narrow',  Arial,  sans-serif;      padding:  60px 0;  /*  Adjust  padding  to  control  vertical  spacing  */      font-size:  50px;  }   .wrapper {\n\nbackground-color:  #90CEE8;      width:  98%;      margin:  1%;      text-align:  center;  /*  Center  the  page  elements  */  }   .wrapper .page {      width:  15%;      height:  180px;      background-color:  #006F9E;      display:  inline-block;      margin:  1%;      vertical-align:  middle;  /*  Vertically  center  content  */  }   .image_link {      max-width:  100%;      max-height:  100%;      display:  block;  /*  Makes  the  image  behave  like  a  block  element  */      margin:  auto;  /*  Center  the  image  within  its  container  */  }   footer {      background-color:  #006F9E;      color:  #fff;      width:  98%;      height:  60px;      margin:  1%;      clear:  both;  /*  Ensures  the  footer  appears  below  the  content  */  }   footer p {      font-family:  'Segoe  UI',  Tahoma,  Geneva,  Verdana,  sans-serif;      text-align:  center;      padding:  20px 0;  /*  Adjust  padding  to  control  vertical  spacing  */  }   Analisis  langkah:  Struktur  CSS  dengan\n\npenggunaan  warna  yang  jelas  untuk  membedakan  tiap  bagian  halaman.  Layout  responsif  sebagian,  karena  menggunakan  inline-block  untuk  menu,  tetapi  mungkin\n\nkurang\n \nfleksibel\n \ndalam\n \ntampilan\n \nmobile.\n Gambar  sudah  diatur  agar  tidak  melebihi  batas  container,  sehingga  tampil  lebih  rapi.\n\nFooter  tidak  menumpuk  dengan  elemen  lain.  6.  Kurang  lebih  tampilan  akan  menjadi  seperti  ini  \n 7.  Terakhir  adalah  pada  bagian  <div  class=”page”>  tambahkan  link  disetiap  page  sehingga  ketika  di  klik  akan  terhubung  ke  web  tersebut  Menu  dengan  Gambar  &  Link  (<div  class=\"page\">)  <div  class=\"page\">      <a  href=\"https://www.google.com/maps\"  alt=\"Google  maps\"  title=\"Google  maps\">           <img  src=\"images/google_maps.png\"  title=\"Maps\"  alt=\"Maps  link\"  \nclass=\"image_link\">\n     </a>  </div>  <div  class=\"page\">  →  Membungkus  setiap  menu  agar  lebih  mudah  diatur  dengan  CSS.  <a  href=\"...\"  title=\"...\">  →  Link  menuju  situs  yang  bersangkutan.  <img  src=\"...\"  title=\"...\"  alt=\"...\"  class=\"image_link\">  →  Gambar  sebagai  ikon/link  menuju  situs  yang  dituju.   8.  Hasil  akhirnya  adalah  web  menu  yang  saling  terhubung  antar  website  seperti  berikut\n\nTugas  Buatlah  program  web  homepage  seperti  contoh  berikut  ini  menggunakan  HTML  dan  CSS  dengan  merubah  font,  background,  aset  gambar  (Untuk  tampilan  CSS  bisa  menggunakan  \nbootstrap)\n 1.

Struktur  Dasar  HTML  Struktur  dan   elemen  dasar  yang  digunakan  yaitu:  <!DOCTYPE  html>  →  Menentukan  bahwa  dokumen  ini  adalah  HTML  <html>  →  Elemen  root  yang  melakukan  wrap  untuk  seluruh  halaman.  <head>  →  Berisi  metadata  halaman,  termasuk  judul  dan  stylesheet.  <body>  →  Berisi  konten  utama  yang  ditampilkan  di  halaman.  2.  Elemen  dalam  <head>  <title>Fast  Access  Web  Menu</title>  →  Menampilkan  judul  halaman  di  tab  browser.  <link  rel=\"stylesheet\"  href=\"CSS/app2.css\">  →  Menghubungkan  halaman  dengan  file  CSS  eksternal  (app2.css).  3.  Elemen  dalam  <body>  a)  <header>  <header>      <h1>Fast  Access  Web  Menu</h1>  </header>  Bagian  header  menampilkan  judul  utama  \"Fast  Access  Web  Menu\"  di  dalam  elemen  <h1>.  b)  Wrapper  (<div  class=\"wrapper\">)  <div  class=\"wrapper\">  Wrapper  ini  berfungsi  sebagai  container  utama  untuk  mengelompokkan  elemen  di  dalamnya.  5.  Tambahkan  file\n\nbaru  bernama  app2.css  pada  folder  csss  dan  tambahkan  kode  sebagai\n\nberikut\n html,  body {      margin:  0px;  }   header {      background-color:  #EB8716;      color:  #fff;      width:  98%;      height:  200px;      margin:  1%;      text-align:  center;  /*  Center  the  header  text  */  }   header h1 {      font-family:  'Franklin  Gothic  Medium',  'Arial  Narrow',  Arial,  sans-serif;      padding:  60px 0;  /*  Adjust  padding  to  control  vertical  spacing  */      font-size:  50px;  }   .wrapper {\n\nbackground-color:  #90CEE8;      width:  98%;      margin:  1%;      text-align:  center;  /*  Center  the  page  elements  */  }   .wrapper .page {      width:  15%;      height:  180px;      background-color:  #006F9E;      display:  inline-block;      margin:  1%;      vertical-align:  middle;  /*  Vertically  center  content  */  }   .image_link {      max-width:  100%;      max-height:  100%;      display:  block;  /*  Makes  the  image  behave  like  a  block  element  */      margin:  auto;  /*  Center  the  image  within  its  container  */  }   footer {      background-color:  #006F9E;      color:  #fff;      width:  98%;      height:  60px;      margin:  1%;      clear:  both;  /*  Ensures  the  footer  appears  below  the  content  */  }   footer p {      font-family:  'Segoe  UI',  Tahoma,  Geneva,  Verdana,  sans-serif;      text-align:  center;      padding:  20px 0;  /*  Adjust  padding  to  control  vertical  spacing  */  }   Analisis  langkah:  Struktur  CSS  dengan\n\npenggunaan  warna  yang  jelas  untuk  membedakan  tiap  bagian  halaman.  Layout  responsif  sebagian,  karena  menggunakan  inline-block  untuk  menu,  tetapi  mungkin\n\nkurang\n \nfleksibel\n \ndalam\n \ntampilan\n \nmobile.\n Gambar  sudah  diatur  agar  tidak  melebihi  batas  container,  sehingga  tampil  lebih  rapi.\n\nFooter  tidak  menumpuk  dengan  elemen  lain.  6.  Kurang  lebih  tampilan  akan  menjadi  seperti  ini  \n 7.  Terakhir  adalah  pada  bagian  <div  class=”page”>  tambahkan  link  disetiap  page  sehingga  ketika  di  klik  akan  terhubung  ke  web  tersebut  Menu  dengan  Gambar  &  Link  (<div  class=\"page\">)  <div  class=\"page\">      <a  href=\"https://www.google.com/maps\"  alt=\"Google  maps\"  title=\"Google  maps\">           <img  src=\"images/google_maps.png\"  title=\"Maps\"  alt=\"Maps  link\"  \nclass=\"image_link\">\n     </a>  </div>  <div  class=\"page\">  →  Membungkus  setiap  menu  agar  lebih  mudah  diatur  dengan  CSS.  <a  href=\"...\"  title=\"...\">  →  Link  menuju  situs  yang  bersangkutan.  <img  src=\"...\"  title=\"...\"  alt=\"...\"  class=\"image_link\">  →  Gambar  sebagai  ikon/link  menuju  situs  yang  dituju.   8.  Hasil  akhirnya  adalah  web  menu  yang  saling  terhubung  antar  website  seperti  berikut\n\nTugas  Buatlah  program  web  homepage  seperti  contoh  berikut  ini  menggunakan  HTML  dan  CSS  dengan  merubah  font,  background,  aset  gambar  (Untuk  tampilan  CSS  bisa  menggunakan  \nbootstrap)\n 1.  Membuat  file  tugas1.html  \n 2.

Latar belakang diberikan efek gradasi linier dengan dua warna untuk \ntampilan yang lebih menarik. Elemen <h1> distyling dengan warna teks dan font tertentu. \nSetelah itu, file HTML direfresh sehingga perubahan tampilan akan terlihat sesuai dengan file\n\nCSS yang telah diterapkan.\n\nPRAKTIKUM TEKNOLOGI WEB SERVICE \nPercobaan 3: Akses Web Menu \nLangkah Percobaan: \n1. Pilih 12 website yang sering dikunjungi. Contoh adalah sebagai berikut \n \n2. Buat direktori dan file seperti berikut ini  \n \n3. Lakukan download gambar dan simpan ke dalam folder images  \n \n4. Pada bagian file web_menu.html tambahkan struktur HTML seperti berikut\n\nPRAKTIKUM TEKNOLOGI WEB SERVICE \n5. Sebagai gambaran page layout adalah sebagai berikut ini \n \n6. Pada bagian <head> pada file web_menu.html tambahkan struktur HTML seperti berikut \n \n7. Selanjutnya pada bagian <body> pada file web_menu.html tambahkan struktur HTML \nseperti berikut\n\nPRAKTIKUM TEKNOLOGI WEB SERVICE \n8. Selanjutnya duplikasi 10 kali <div>... <div> yang kedalam  <div \nclass=”wrapper”> seperti berikut\n\nPRAKTIKUM TEKNOLOGI WEB SERVICE \n \n9. Tambahkan file baru bernama app.css pada folder css dan tambahkan kode sebagai berikut\n\nPRAKTIKUM TEKNOLOGI WEB SERVICE \n10. Kurang lebih tampilan akan menjadi seperti ini, silahkan ubah warna/text/background \nsesuai dengan kebutuhan \n \n11. Sebelum menambahkan gambar ke dokumen HTML, lakukan perubahan nama pada \nimages untuk memudahkan memasukan kedalam dokumen HTML. \n12. Pada bagian <div class=”page”> pada file web_menu.html tambahkan struktur HTML \nseperti berikut. \n \n13. Sehingga bagian <div class=”page”> yang lain akan berbentuk berdasarkan data yang \nada di images\n\nPRAKTIKUM TEKNOLOGI WEB SERVICE \n14. Selanjutnya masukan kode berikut ini ke dala file app.css \n \n15. Hasil kurang lebih akan seperti ini\n\nPRAKTIKUM TEKNOLOGI WEB SERVICE \n16. Terakhir adalah pada bagian <div class=”page”>  tambahkan link disetiap page \nsehingga ketika di klik akan terhubung ke web tersebut \n \n17. Hasil akhirnya adalah web menu yang saling terhubung antar website seperti berikut ini. \n \nAnalisis: \n Percobaan ini bertujuan untuk membuat halaman web yang menampilkan daftar 10 \nwebsite populer berdasarkan pencarian banyak orang dengan langkah awal menentukan daftar \nwebsite tersebut, lalu menyimpan ikon atau logo masing -masing ke dalam folder Images. \nSetelah itu, dibuat file web_menu.html yang berisi struktur dasar HTML, termasuk pengaturan \njudul halaman di tab browser dan tautan ke file app.css untuk mengatur tampilan. Sebagai \nwadah utama, digunakan elemen wrapper yang berisi 10 elemen page, masing -masing \nberfungsi sebagai tempat meletakkan logo website yang diambil dari folder Images. Setiap logo\n\nPRAKTIKUM TEKNOLOGI WEB SERVICE \nditampilkan menggunakan elemen gambar dan ditautkan dengan navigasi agar saat diklik, \npengguna diarahkan langsung ke website terkait. Terakhir, ditambahkan bagian footer untuk \nmencantumkan informasi pemilik website.\n\nPRAKTIKUM TEKNOLOGI WEB SERVICE \nE. LATIHAN \nBuatlah program akses web menu dengan merubah font, background, aset gambar berdasarkan \nkreativitas mahasiswa! \n1.

Dalam kode HTML \nterdapat class wrapper, page, dan image_link. Dimana fungsi ketiganya adalah sebagai berikut: \n- Class wrapper berfungsi untuk membuat container dasar untuk menampung semua gambar. \n- Class page untuk menampung masing-masing gambar di atas wrapper.  \n- Image_link untuk memungkinkannya pengguna untuk mengklik gambar dan menuju link yang telah \ndi atur untuk masing -masing gambar serta memberikan efek abu -abu saat cursor diarahkan ke \ngambar.\n\napp.css digunakan untuk melakukan dekorasi pada file HTML yang telah dibuat. Seperti contoh warna \norange dengan tulisan berwarnakan puti h, mengubah warna dan ukuran untuk wrapper dan page.\n\nMengatur warna dan ukuran untuk footer lalu, ditampilkan dengan background berwarna biru tua \nbeserta tulisan copyright. \n \nTugas \n \n<html lang=\"en\"> \n<head> \n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> \n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"> \n    <title>SEVENTEEN</title> \n    <link rel = \"icon\" \nhref=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e1/f5/2c/e1f52c774a56c2ca36cdb81ef6321e0e.jpg\" \ntype=\"image/png\"> \n    <link href=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css\" \nrel=\"stylesheet\"> \n</head> \n<body class=\"bg-white text-dark\"> \n    <div class=\"container mt-4\"> \n        <div class=\"text-center\"> \n            <h1 class=\"display-3\">SEVENTEEN</h1> \n        </div> \n        <div class=\"row mt-5\"> \n            <div class=\"col-md-8\"> \n                <h2>About Us</h2> \n                <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(South_Korean_band)\" \nclass=\"text-primary\">SEVENTEEN</a> is a boy group from south korea, which consists of 13 members\n\nand debuted in 2017.</p> \n                <h3>SAY THE NAME!

CSS menetapkan margin nol untuk menghilangkan ruang \ndefault, kemudian menerapkan gradien warna dari biru muda (#95d9f9) ke ungu (#ae4bc3) \nsebagai latar belakang, menciptakan efek transisi warna yang halus. Selanjutnya, teks \"Hello,\n\nWorld!\" diberi warna biru (#1b95cd) dengan jenis huruf Tahoma untuk tampilan yang lebih \nmodern dan profesional. \n \nPercobaan 3: Akses Web Menu \n \nLangkah Percobaan: \n1. Pilih 10 website yang sering dikunjungi. Contoh adalah sebagai berikut\n\ngmeet spotify \ngoogle youtubekids \ngmail whatsaap \nlinkedin bluetooth \npinterest playstore \n \n2.

Selanjutnya duplikasi 12 kali <div>...</div> yang kedalam <div class=”wrapper”> \nseperti berikut\n\n9. Tambahkan file baru bernama app2.css pada folder csss dan tambahkan kode sebagai \nberikut \n \n \n \n \n10. Kurang lebih tampilan akan menjadi seperti ini, silakan ubah warna /text/background \nsesuai dengan kebutuhan \n \n \n11. Sebelum menambahkan gambar ke dokumen HTML, lakukan perubahan nama pada\n\nimages untuk memudahkan memasukan kedalam dokumen HTML seperti berikut. \n \nimages/gmeet.jpg images/spotify.jpg \nimages/google.jpg images/youtubekids.jpg \nimages/gmail.jpg images/whatsaap.jpg \nimages/linkedin.jpg images/bluetooth.jpg \nimages/pinterest.jpg images/playstore.jpg \n \n12. Pada bagian <div class=”page”> pada file web_menu.html tambahkan struktur HTML \nseperti berikut \n \n13. Sehingga bagian <div class=”page”> yang lain akan berbentuk berdasarkan data yang \nada di images \n \n14. Selanjutnya masukan kode berikut ini ke dalam file app.css \n \n15. Hasil kurang lebih akan seperti ini\n\n16. Terakhir adalah pada bagian  <div class=”page”> tambahkan link disetiap page \nsehingga ketika di klik akan terhubung ke web tersebut \n \n \nAnalisis: \nKode HTML dan CSS di atas digunakan  untuk membuat halaman web dengan menu akses \ncepat ke berbagai situs populer, ditampilkan dalam bentuk gambar yang bisa diklik. Struktur \nHTML terdiri dari header, kontainer utama (wrapper) yang berisi daftar ikon situs dalam \nelemen <div class=\"page\">, sert a footer. Setiap ikon situs dibuat sebagai tautan <a> dengan \ngambar di dalamnya. CSS digunakan untuk mempercantik tampilan, seperti memberikan warna \nlatar belakang oranye pada header, biru pada kontainer utama dan footer, serta efek hover yang \nmembuat gambar menjadi grayscale 70%. Tata letak dibuat responsif dengan lebar elemen \nyang menyesuaikan layar menggunakan persentase dan vw (viewport width). Secara \nkeseluruhan, kode ini menyusun halaman web yang simpel namun fungsional untuk akses cepat \nke berbagai situs populer.\n\nLATIHAN \n \nBuatlah program akses web menu dengan merubah font, background, aset gambar berdasarkan \nkreativitas mahasiswa! \n \nKODE:  \n \nHTML DAN CSS \n \n \n \nOUTPUT:\n\nAnalisis:  \nKode di atas bertujuan untuk membuat halaman web sederhana yang menyediakan akses cepat \nke berbagai situs populer melalui ikon gambar yang dapat diklik. Halaman ini memiliki header \ndengan judul \"Fast Access Website\" yang ditampilkan di bagian atas dengan latar belakan g \nabu-abu gelap dan teks putih. Bagian utama berisi dua baris tautan berbentuk gambar, masing-\nmasing mengarah ke situs seperti Spotify, Google, Pinterest, YouTube Kids, Zoom, LinkedIn, \nSamsung, WhatsApp, Windows, dan Play Store. Setiap gambar ditampilkan d engan ukuran \n15% dari ukuran aslinya untuk menjaga konsistensi tampilan. Struktur halaman menggunakan \nelemen HTML dasar seperti <ul> untuk menyusun daftar tautan, meskipun penggunaan kelas \nCSS pada <ul> kurang tepat karena sintaksisnya tidak sesuai. Di bagian bawah, terdapat footer \ndengan teks hak cipta yang memberikan informasi kepemilikan halaman. Dari segi desain, kode\n\nini cukup sederhana tetapi masih bisa ditingkatkan, misalnya dengan perbaikan pada sintaks \nCSS dan penggunaan elemen <div> atau <nav> untuk struktur yang lebih rapi.\n\nTUGAS \n \nBuatlah program web homepage seperti contoh berikut ini menggunakan HTML dan CSS \ndengan merubah font, background, aset gambar berdasarkan kreativitas mahasiswa! \n \nKODE:  \n \nHTML\n\nCSS\n\nOUTPUT: \n \n \nAnalisis:  \nKode HTML dan CSS di atas  digunakan untuk membuat halaman portfolio pribadi \nmenggunakan Bootstrap.

Disini text hello world \nada di dalam tag H1. Membuat text tersebut menjadi seperti heading 1. \n \nPercobaan 2 : Menambahkan CSS \nKode HTML :\n\nKode CSS :  \n \nHasil :  \n \n \nPercobaan 3 : Akses Web Menu \nKode HTML serta javascriptnya :\n\nKode CSS :  \n \nHasil:  \n \nPenjelasan :  \nMenggunakan javascript yang membantu membuat html secara otomatis. Maksudnya, javascript \nini melakukan looping pada list_sosmed, dimana nama file foto dan yang ada di list_sosmed \nsama. Karena itu, looping javascript bisa menampilkan atau menambahkan html serta href-nya \ndari isi list_sosmed. Selain itu, menggunakan display grid pada kelas wrapper membantu agar \nsecara praktis membuat html terstruktur. Dimana diatur 5 kolom dan 2 baris. Jadi hasil dari \njavascript, di style dengan css, lalu terbentuklah hasil seperti yang terlampir. Selain itu, header \ndan footer dilakukan seperti pada umumnya.

Warna background footer saya \nubah menjadi ungu muda agar lebih natural , dan warna tulisannya menjadi hitam \nagar tetap terbaca. Kemudian, gambar logo website saya kecilkan agar lebih rapi, \ndan saya mengganti 2 website menjadi youtube dan wattpad.\n\nC. Tugas \n1. Source code coba.html \n \n \n \n2. Source code coba.css\n\n3. Hasil \n \nMenampilkan homepage mengenai NCT Dream menggunakan bootstrap 5 agar \ntampilan layout -nya bisa fleksibel menyesuaikan layar tiap pengguna. Terda pat \njudul di tengah atas, kemudian tabel yang berisi album-album terbaru di bagian kiri, \nfoto NCT Dream di sebelah kanan , dan di bagian bawahnya terdapat nama -nama \nmember dalam bentuk list-group. Selain itu, terdapat form untuk mengisi pesan dan \nemail menggunakan bootstrap form control , tapi karena web ini belum ada \ndatabase-nya, sehingga hasil submit pesan itu tidak akan tersimpan di manapun. \nTampilan web ini standar dengan background putih dan tulisan hitam, font yang \ndigunakan juga sans-serif.",

Dalam kode HTML \nterdapat class wrapper, page, dan image_link. Dimana fungsi ketiganya adalah sebagai berikut: \n- Class wrapper berfungsi untuk membuat container dasar untuk menampung semua gambar. \n- Class page untuk menampung masing-masing gambar di atas wrapper.  \n- Image_link untuk memungkinkannya pengguna untuk mengklik gambar dan menuju link yang telah \ndi atur untuk masing -masing gambar serta memberikan efek abu -abu saat cursor diarahkan ke \ngambar.\n\napp.css digunakan untuk melakukan dekorasi pada file HTML yang telah dibuat. Seperti contoh warna \norange dengan tulisan berwarnakan puti h, mengubah warna dan ukuran untuk wrapper dan page.\n\nMengatur warna dan ukuran untuk footer lalu, ditampilkan dengan background berwarna biru tua \nbeserta tulisan copyright. \n \nTugas \n \n<html lang=\"en\"> \n<head> \n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> \n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"> \n    <title>SEVENTEEN</title> \n    <link rel = \"icon\" \nhref=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e1/f5/2c/e1f52c774a56c2ca36cdb81ef6321e0e.jpg\" \ntype=\"image/png\"> \n    <link href=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css\" \nrel=\"stylesheet\"> \n</head> \n<body class=\"bg-white text-dark\"> \n    <div class=\"container mt-4\"> \n        <div class=\"text-center\"> \n            <h1 class=\"display-3\">SEVENTEEN</h1> \n        </div> \n        <div class=\"row mt-5\"> \n            <div class=\"col-md-8\"> \n                <h2>About Us</h2> \n                <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(South_Korean_band)\" \nclass=\"text-primary\">SEVENTEEN</a> is a boy group from south korea, which consists of 13 members\n\nand debuted in 2017.</p> \n                <h3>SAY THE NAME!

CSS menetapkan margin nol untuk menghilangkan ruang \ndefault, kemudian menerapkan gradien warna dari biru muda (#95d9f9) ke ungu (#ae4bc3) \nsebagai latar belakang, menciptakan efek transisi warna yang halus. Selanjutnya, teks \"Hello,\n\nWorld!\" diberi warna biru (#1b95cd) dengan jenis huruf Tahoma untuk tampilan yang lebih \nmodern dan profesional. \n \nPercobaan 3: Akses Web Menu \n \nLangkah Percobaan: \n1. Pilih 10 website yang sering dikunjungi. Contoh adalah sebagai berikut\n\ngmeet spotify \ngoogle youtubekids \ngmail whatsaap \nlinkedin bluetooth \npinterest playstore \n \n2.

Selanjutnya duplikasi 12 kali <div>...</div> yang kedalam <div class=”wrapper”> \nseperti berikut\n\n9. Tambahkan file baru bernama app2.css pada folder csss dan tambahkan kode sebagai \nberikut \n \n \n \n \n10. Kurang lebih tampilan akan menjadi seperti ini, silakan ubah warna /text/background \nsesuai dengan kebutuhan \n \n \n11. Sebelum menambahkan gambar ke dokumen HTML, lakukan perubahan nama pada\n\nimages untuk memudahkan memasukan kedalam dokumen HTML seperti berikut. \n \nimages/gmeet.jpg images/spotify.jpg \nimages/google.jpg images/youtubekids.jpg \nimages/gmail.jpg images/whatsaap.jpg \nimages/linkedin.jpg images/bluetooth.jpg \nimages/pinterest.jpg images/playstore.jpg \n \n12. Pada bagian <div class=”page”> pada file web_menu.html tambahkan struktur HTML \nseperti berikut \n \n13. Sehingga bagian <div class=”page”> yang lain akan berbentuk berdasarkan data yang \nada di images \n \n14. Selanjutnya masukan kode berikut ini ke dalam file app.css \n \n15. Hasil kurang lebih akan seperti ini\n\n16. Terakhir adalah pada bagian  <div class=”page”> tambahkan link disetiap page \nsehingga ketika di klik akan terhubung ke web tersebut \n \n \nAnalisis: \nKode HTML dan CSS di atas digunakan  untuk membuat halaman web dengan menu akses \ncepat ke berbagai situs populer, ditampilkan dalam bentuk gambar yang bisa diklik. Struktur \nHTML terdiri dari header, kontainer utama (wrapper) yang berisi daftar ikon situs dalam \nelemen <div class=\"page\">, sert a footer. Setiap ikon situs dibuat sebagai tautan <a> dengan \ngambar di dalamnya. CSS digunakan untuk mempercantik tampilan, seperti memberikan warna \nlatar belakang oranye pada header, biru pada kontainer utama dan footer, serta efek hover yang \nmembuat gambar menjadi grayscale 70%. Tata letak dibuat responsif dengan lebar elemen \nyang menyesuaikan layar menggunakan persentase dan vw (viewport width). Secara \nkeseluruhan, kode ini menyusun halaman web yang simpel namun fungsional untuk akses cepat \nke berbagai situs populer.\n\nLATIHAN \n \nBuatlah program akses web menu dengan merubah font, background, aset gambar berdasarkan \nkreativitas mahasiswa! \n \nKODE:  \n \nHTML DAN CSS \n \n \n \nOUTPUT:\n\nAnalisis:  \nKode di atas bertujuan untuk membuat halaman web sederhana yang menyediakan akses cepat \nke berbagai situs populer melalui ikon gambar yang dapat diklik. Halaman ini memiliki header \ndengan judul \"Fast Access Website\" yang ditampilkan di bagian atas dengan latar belakan g \nabu-abu gelap dan teks putih. Bagian utama berisi dua baris tautan berbentuk gambar, masing-\nmasing mengarah ke situs seperti Spotify, Google, Pinterest, YouTube Kids, Zoom, LinkedIn, \nSamsung, WhatsApp, Windows, dan Play Store. Setiap gambar ditampilkan d engan ukuran \n15% dari ukuran aslinya untuk menjaga konsistensi tampilan. Struktur halaman menggunakan \nelemen HTML dasar seperti <ul> untuk menyusun daftar tautan, meskipun penggunaan kelas \nCSS pada <ul> kurang tepat karena sintaksisnya tidak sesuai. Di bagian bawah, terdapat footer \ndengan teks hak cipta yang memberikan informasi kepemilikan halaman. Dari segi desain, kode\n\nini cukup sederhana tetapi masih bisa ditingkatkan, misalnya dengan perbaikan pada sintaks \nCSS dan penggunaan elemen <div> atau <nav> untuk struktur yang lebih rapi.\n\nTUGAS \n \nBuatlah program web homepage seperti contoh berikut ini menggunakan HTML dan CSS \ndengan merubah font, background, aset gambar berdasarkan kreativitas mahasiswa! \n \nKODE:  \n \nHTML\n\nCSS\n\nOUTPUT: \n \n \nAnalisis:  \nKode HTML dan CSS di atas  digunakan untuk membuat halaman portfolio pribadi \nmenggunakan Bootstrap.

Disini text hello world \nada di dalam tag H1. Membuat text tersebut menjadi seperti heading 1. \n \nPercobaan 2 : Menambahkan CSS \nKode HTML :\n\nKode CSS :  \n \nHasil :  \n \n \nPercobaan 3 : Akses Web Menu \nKode HTML serta javascriptnya :\n\nKode CSS :  \n \nHasil:  \n \nPenjelasan :  \nMenggunakan javascript yang membantu membuat html secara otomatis. Maksudnya, javascript \nini melakukan looping pada list_sosmed, dimana nama file foto dan yang ada di list_sosmed \nsama. Karena itu, looping javascript bisa menampilkan atau menambahkan html serta href-nya \ndari isi list_sosmed. Selain itu, menggunakan display grid pada kelas wrapper membantu agar \nsecara praktis membuat html terstruktur. Dimana diatur 5 kolom dan 2 baris. Jadi hasil dari \njavascript, di style dengan css, lalu terbentuklah hasil seperti yang terlampir. Selain itu, header \ndan footer dilakukan seperti pada umumnya.

Tag body yang akan menampung semua tulisan untuk ditampilkan di web \nmelalui aplikasi web browser.  \n \nPada tag body, diisi struktur seperti pada gambar. Body akan Menampilkan header, \nfooter, dan kumpulan image yang disimpan dalam tag div. Tag div digunakan sebagai \ncontainer untuk beberapa tag html dan salah satu tag html yang memiliki nilai display \nblock. Div digunakan untuk membedakan bagian dalam element html. Pada kasus ini \nada header dan footer.  \nDisini ada dua tag div yang digunakan. Fungsi pertama untuk menyimpan kumpulan \ngambar yang dikelompokkan dalam satu kelas “wrapper” dan  fungsi kedua untuk \nmenyimpan set iap gambar dimana setiap gambar memiliki beberapa ele ment html \nseperti tag a, tag img, atribut href, src, alt, dan title yang dikelompokkan dalam satu \nkelas page. \nDisini akan saya jelaskan tag div yang kedua . Pertama tag a, tag ini berfungsi untuk\n\nmerujuk pada link yang kita inputkan. Tag a memili ki atribut href, alt, dan title. href \nberisi lokasi link tujuan, alt untuk teks alternatif jika link tidak bisa ditampilkan, dan \ntitle akan menampilkan judul saat mouse berada di link tersebut. \nDi dalam tag a ada tag img untuk menampilkan gambar. Di dalamnya terdapat elmen \nsrc, title, alt, dan class. src berisi link tempat gambar disimpan, title akan Menampilkan \njudul saat mouse diarahkan ke gambar. alt sebagai teks alternatif saat gambar tidak \nbisa ditampilkan, dan tag class untuk mendefinisikan kelas dari gambar tersebut yaitu \n“image_link”. Tag img termasuk void element. \nKarena aka nada 10 gambar, maka tag div kedua akan dicopy sebanyak 10 kali. Jadi \npada tag div pertama akan menampung 10 gambar. \nKode CSS \nhtml, body { \n    margin: 0px; \n} \n \nheader {\n\nbackground-color: #eb8716; \n    color: #fff; \n    width: 98%; \n    height: 200px; \n    margin: 1%; \n} \n \nheader h1 { \n    text-align: center; \n    font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif; \n    padding: 60px; \n    font-size: 50px; \n} \n \n.wrapper { \n    background-color: #90cee8; \n    width: 98%; \n    height: 400px; \n    margin: 1%; \n} \n \n.wrapper .page { \n    width: 18%; \n    height: 180px; \n    background-color: #006f9e; \n    display: inline-block; \n    margin: 0.4%; \n} \n \nfooter { \n    background-color: #006f9e; \n    color: #fff; \n    width: 98%; \n    height: 60px; \n    margin: 1%; \n} \n \nfooter p { \n    font-family: 'Segoe UI', Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; \n    text-align: center; \n    padding: 20px; \n} \n \n.image_link {\n\nheight: 180px; \n    width: 18.5vw; \n    margin: 1% 0 1% 1%; \n} \n \n.image_link:hover { \n    filter: grayscale(75%); \n} \nAnalisa \nDisini akan diatur ketentuan untuk s tyle yang diinginkan. Untuk mengatur aturan tag \nberbeda dengan kelas. Aturan tag tinggal ditulis nama tag nya. Sedangkan untuk kelas \ndiawali dengan titik dan diikuti nama kelas. \nBanyak aturanyang d idefinisikan disini salah satunya l ayout dari gambar akan \ndibentuk menggunakan display inline block dan diterapkan pada kelas “wrapper” dan \n“page”. \nHasil\n\nD.

Kelebihannya yaitu bisa \nmenampilkan audio dan video. Strukturnya sama, dimulai dengan tag html, head, dan \nbody. Untuk membuat web homepage, digunakanlah library bootstrap. Beberapa kelas \ndigunakan untuk membuat web homepage diantaranya container, row, column, image, \ndan table. \nUntuk menggunakan boots trap harus mengimpornya terlebih dahulu melalui sebuah \nlink yang ditempatkan pada tag head. \nDi bagian body, menggunakan tag div untuk menyimpan semua tag dan element html \nyang digunakan. Penggunaan div juga karena div support dengan display block.  \nDiv pertama dibuat dengan mendefinisikan s ebuah class container dari bootstrap . \nSemua tag element akan diatur jadi satu kelas yaitu “container”.  \nKemudian ada tag div lagi dengan mengimpor kelas row dari bootstrap untuk mengatur \nposisi teks perkenalan dan image. Untuk m engerjakannya, mengimpor lagi kelas text\n\ndan image dari bootst rap. Posisi gambar yang berada di kanan d engan sudut tumpul \njuga diatur menggunakan kelas dari bootstrap yaitu “rounded float-end”. \nMenggunakan class row dan col dari bootstrap untuk mengatur tata letak tabel dan \ntulisan. Untuk membuat tabel juga menggunakan class table dari bootstrap. Disini saya \nmenggunakan class table yang Menampilkan hover saat baris tabel disentuh. \nUntuk membuat list ekstrakurikuler digunakan kelas col untuk mengatur tata letak dan \nposisinya. Kemudian mengatur contact dengan menggunakan kelas mb dari bootstrap. \nPada contact menggunakan class dari bootst rap yaitu form -control untuk membuat \nmodel form. \nTerakhir menggunakan class btn dari bootst rap untuk membuat tampilan tombol \nsubmit. \nKode CSS \nhtml, body { \n    margin: 20px; \n    padding: 20px; \n    background: linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(104,162,37,1) 27%, rgba(179,222,129,1) \n100%); \n} \n.container {\n\nfont-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans \nUnicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; \n} \n.about-text { \n    flex: 1; /* Mengatur teks agar menempati ruang tersisa */ \n    font-size: 18px; \n    text-align: justify; \n}\n\n.about-image img { \n    max-width: 355px;  \n    height: auto; \n} \nAnalisa \nAturan style css akan diterapkan pada tag html  dan body serta beberapa kelas yang \ndiimport dari bootstrap. \nDi bagian html bo dy m enerapkan margin dan padding serta men gatur warna \nbackground nya dengan gradasi warna. \nSemua kelas container menggunakan font-family Lucida \nUntuk kelas about-text mengatur flex 1 agar text yang diinput bisa menyesuaikan dan \nmenempati ruangan yang tersisa .
